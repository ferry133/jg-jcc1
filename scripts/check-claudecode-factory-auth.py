"""Assert the two-tenant split in front of claude-code (jgct#84).

Ruled by ferry133 2026-09-06: `im` is the factory's support agent, so it uses
the factory's Auth0. That splits one set of values into two, and every way of
getting the split wrong is a gate defect on a root shell with cluster-admin
that the tunnel publishes to the internet:

  factory  auth0.json (gitignored, factory-supplied) -> FACTORY_AUTH0_DOMAIN /
           _CLIENT_ID / _CLIENT_SECRET / FACTORY_ALLOWED_EMAILS. Required on
           every cluster whenever OIDC is on, because every cluster ships the
           base im. Missing file, or an empty allowlist, must FAIL THE RENDER --
           fail-closed at the door instead reads like a broken cluster from
           outside (measured 2026-09-06: a 403 nobody could attribute).

  customer cluster.yaml's claudecode_auth0_* -- required only when the cluster
           names its own instances in claude_instances, and never inherited
           from auth0.json. Inheriting would put a customer's terminal behind
           the factory gate: the mirror image of the defect jgct#64 closed.

The cases below are the two-way version of that: the values must be present
when they are needed, ABSENT-tolerant when they are not, and the two tenants
must not be mixed. A test that only checked the happy path would pass on a
plugin that put everyone behind one tenant, which is the state #84 exists to end.

age_key is stubbed: these cases chdir into a fixture directory (auth0.json is
read relative to the cluster directory), which puts the real age.key out of
reach. The derivations it feeds are covered by check-claudecode-postgres-derive.py.
