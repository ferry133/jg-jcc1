"""Assert what `nas_backup` derives to, per whether the cluster has a NAS.

This one word decides whether the database extras render their NAS backup
CronJob at all (jg-base selects a directory with it:
`.../postgres/backup/${NAS_BACKUP:=nfs}`), and both ways of getting it wrong
are quiet:

  stuck 'nfs'   an appliance renders a PersistentVolume with an empty
                `nfs.server`, the API server rejects it, and the Kustomization
                carrying it goes Ready=False. That is ferry133/jg-base#17,
                where the invalid PV lived alongside the database and took the
                database with it.

  stuck 'none'  every cluster with a NAS silently stops taking database dumps
                to it. Nothing goes red; the backups just stop, and that is
                indistinguishable from working until someone needs a restore.

The word also has to survive the trip into a `stringData` field. `''` is YAML
null and `false` is a YAML boolean, and either one gets the whole Secret
rejected -- ferry133/jg-base#16 cost a cluster its entire daily-check that way.

It exercises the real Plugin.data() rather than a copy of its logic. A
reimplementation here would drift, and the copy that drifts is the one that
keeps passing.

Exit 0 if every case matches, 1 otherwise.
