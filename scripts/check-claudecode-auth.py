"""Check the gate in front of claude-code before anything is rendered.

Every cluster runs a claude-code instance: a root shell with cluster-admin
RBAC that the Cloudflare tunnel exposes to the internet the moment it connects
— no port forward, no firewall change — and whose hostname enters Certificate
Transparency logs as soon as cert-manager issues for it. There is no obscurity
to fall back on, and `replicas: 0` is a posture rather than a control: anything
that scales it up removes it.

Two modes, so two checks:

  Auth0 (the default)   TWO tenants since 2026-09-06 (jgct#84). auth0.json —
                        gitignored, factory-supplied — is the FACTORY tenant and
                        gates the base `im`, so it is REQUIRED on every cluster,
                        all four keys including allowed_emails. cluster.yaml's
                        claudecode_auth0_* are the CUSTOMER tenant and are
                        required only when claude_instances names an instance.
                        Absent, the render dies partway through with a
                        traceback; empty, it deploys an oauth2-proxy that
                        cannot start — and OIDC mode gives ttyd no fallback, so
                        that is a terminal nobody reaches.

                        Until `#64` this said "the shared application's", and
                        told operators to copy auth0.json from another cluster.
                        The 2026-08-25 ruling gives every cluster its own
                        tenant; a cluster that deliberately shares one says so
                        with `claudecode_auth0_shared: true`. This check runs
                        SECOND in `:configure:` and the render is tenth, so
                        whatever this file says is what an operator acts on —
                        the message in plugin.py is never reached.

                        An operator-declared cookie secret is checked here too.
                        It is optional and derived correctly when absent, so the
                        only way to get it wrong is to write one — which one
                        cluster did, and paid the full price for (#17).

  claudecode_auth0:     ttyd basic auth is the whole gate, so the credential
  false                 must exist and must not be guessable. Before this
                        check, an unset one rendered an empty --credential and
                        published an unauthenticated shell.

The strength rules live here rather than in cluster.schema.cue because a CUE
constraint prints the offending value in its error message. A check that leaks
the credential into a terminal and a CI log in order to complain about it is
worse than no check, so nothing below ever prints the value — only what is
wrong with it.

Usage: check-claudecode-auth.py [cluster.yaml]
Exit 0 if acceptable, 1 otherwise.
