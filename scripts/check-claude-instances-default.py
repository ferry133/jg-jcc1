"""Assert what an unset `claude_code_always_on` renders to, per instance count.

Since 2026-09-06 the standing way in is jg-base's static im instance, and
claude_instances (default []) names EXTRA instances only — "im" in it is
refused outright, because the base HelmRelease already owns that object name.
The always_on default still has to hit three different answers for the
extras, and two of them are easy to get wrong in a way nothing reports:

  exactly one instance -> that one          (a renamed/extra terminal the
                                             cluster clearly wants standing)
  more than one        -> [] and say so     (picking one would be a guess --
                                             the #57 lesson, kept)
  zero instances       -> [] and say NOTHING (the DEFAULT now; a guard that
                                             flags correct input is worse
                                             than none -- jg-base#18)

The stderr note is asserted in BOTH directions. Asserting only that it fires
leaves the case it must NOT fire on invisible, which is how the zero-instance
false alarm survived review twice.
