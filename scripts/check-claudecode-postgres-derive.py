"""Assert how explicit-memory PostgreSQL creds are derived (jgct#85).

Since 2026-09-06 postgres ships from jg-base as a base app and cluster.yaml no
longer carries the password or the URL. plugin.py derives both:

  claudecode_postgres_password  HMAC(age.key, "claudecode-postgres:<cluster>"),
                                hex — cluster.yaml may override to rotate.
  claude_code_database_url      DERIVED from that password, never a field:
                                postgresql://claudecode:<pw>@postgres.claudecode.svc/claudecode

Four things this checks, and each is a way the change fails silently:

  hex output          the password goes into a URL; base64url's -/_/= would need
                      percent-encoding and a URL parser would trip. hex never does.
  URL carries THE pw  a URL composed from a different value than the password in
                      cluster-secrets is two truths that drift (jg-base#73's whole
                      reason for composing here, not in jg-base).
  override wins       rotation has to have an exit; a default that clobbered an
                      explicit value would make rotation impossible.
  extras render error listing claudecode/postgres as an extra makes the user repo
                      and base fight over one Kustomization name — must abort.

age_key is stubbed to a fixed string: this tests the DERIVATION, deterministically,
without a real age.key (a bare checkout has none). The value is not a real secret.
