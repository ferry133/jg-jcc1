"""Assert what `lb_pool_blocks` renders to, per deployment profile.

Exists because of ferry133/jg-cluster-template#10, whose defect was not a wrong
value but an **unreachable branch**: the appliance case sat behind `if addrs:`,
and `lan_shared_addr` back-filled two of the three fields `addrs` is built from.
So the branch stopped executing the moment an operator followed
fleet-ops docs/operations/router-dns.md and declared the shared address — and nothing in
the source looked wrong, because the branch was still there.

An unreachable branch is invisible to review and to every check that reads the
rendered output of *some other* profile. The only thing that catches it is
asserting the value for each profile, which is what this does.

It exercises the real Plugin.data() rather than a copy of its logic. A
reimplementation here would drift, and the copy that drifts is the one that
keeps passing.

Exit 0 if every case matches, 1 otherwise.
