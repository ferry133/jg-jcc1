"""Assert what an unset `claudecode_config_storage_class` renders to (#76).

Since 2026-09-05 the default is `db_storage_class` — the block tier. The
ruling: claude's auto memory (~/.claude PVC) and explicit memory (PostgreSQL)
never live on NFS. The default could only change AFTER every cluster from
before the ruling migrated and wrote its class into cluster.yaml, because
`storageClassName` is immutable: on an unmigrated cluster the new default
renders a PVC the cluster cannot accept, and the only symptom is a pod that
never starts while every Kustomization reads Ready.

Three answers matter, and the third is the one a happy-path test misses:

  unset, NFS cluster    -> db_storage_class (block), while the workspace PVC
                           stays on default_storage_class (NFS) — the two
                           tiers must decouple, that is the whole point
  unset, db declared    -> follows db_storage_class
  explicitly named      -> kept verbatim. An explicit value is how a cluster
                           RECORDS where its immutable PVC actually is; a
                           default that clobbered it would silently re-render
                           the one PVC that must not move.
