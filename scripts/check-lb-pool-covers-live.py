"""Check the rendered LoadBalancer pool covers every address currently assigned.

Run this BEFORE pushing a narrowed pool. "Did anything break after narrowing?"
is the wrong question: Cilium does not revoke an address when the pool that
supplied it goes away, so a missing address looks fine until the Service is next
recreated — a Helm upgrade or a node event, days later, with nothing connecting
cause to effect. See fleet-ops openspec/changes/deployment-profiles/design.md D26.

Usage:  KUBECONFIG=… SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=… ./scripts/check-lb-pool-covers-live.py [repo]
Exit 0 if every assigned address is covered, 1 otherwise.
