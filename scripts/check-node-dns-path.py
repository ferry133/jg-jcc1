"""Assert what `node_dns_path` derives to, per node_dns_servers shape.

daily-check probes `internal.<domain>` through the node's ordinary resolution
path and raises an alarm when it fails. This flag decides whether that probe
runs at all, so both ways of getting it wrong are silent:

  stuck `lan`     a cluster whose nodes point at 1.1.1.1 alarms every morning
                  while its LAN is perfectly healthy — Cloudflare will not
                  serve the RFC1918 answer (deployment-profiles D29), so the
                  probe can never pass there. A permanently red row trains the
                  reader to ignore the channel carrying seventeen other checks.

  stuck `public`  the probe never runs anywhere. Since jg-base#16 that at least
                  prints an explicit "not measured" row rather than nothing,
                  but nothing about the router is being watched.

Neither shows up in a rendered manifest, because the value is computed before
rendering and only ever appears as one word.

The first case below is the one this file exists for. It used to expect the
opposite answer: the derivation read `node_dns_servers` BEFORE plugin.py's own
`setdefault(...)` and called unset "LAN", while the case right after it asserted
`public` for the identical machine config. Measured 2026-08-23: jg-jiahd, jcom,
jg-janncotcc and jgt-talos-accept all rendered `nameservers: [1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1]`,
and no cluster.yaml in the fleet set the field — so the branch that said "LAN"
described no cluster that existed.

It exercises the real Plugin.data() rather than a copy of its logic. A
reimplementation here would drift, and the copy that drifts is the one that
keeps passing.

**2026-08-27 — that rule was written here and then broken here**
(`ferry133/jg-cluster-template#32`). This file did not reimplement the logic,
but it did hold a copy of one *value* the logic owns: the default itself, spelled
`["1.1.1.1", "1.0.0.1"]` in a case named "the applied default spelled out" and
again in the self-agreement assertion at the bottom. `#29` changed the default in
plugin.py to `[node_default_gateway]` and the copy here stayed. The two then
contradicted each other, and because this guard sits on the `task configure`
chain, **every cluster repo synced to main stopped being able to render at all** —
including `jg-jiahd`, which was only trying to pick up an unrelated fix.

So the fix is not to write the new default in these two places. It is to stop
holding the value: the self-agreement assertion below now reads the applied
default back out of `Plugin.data()`, which is the one spelling that cannot go
stale. What stays hard-coded is the *policy* — unset must put the nodes on the
LAN — because that is the thing worth failing over if someone changes it back.

Note what this guard got right, because the temptation when it fires is to
loosen it: it refused loudly instead of letting a contradictory default render
quietly, and `#29` exists precisely because both ways of being wrong here are
silent. The cost was one `exit 201`. Do not fix it by relaxing an assertion.

Exit 0 if every case matches, 1 otherwise.
